---BACKGROUNDS---
The size of the image is 16x the amount of pixels in map.png for that level
Eg: W and H of a map that is 180 * 90 is 180 * 16 and 90 * 16

NEWLY ADDED: Because bg's for large maps would get very big-
Magnification/enlargement is now available, simply specify it when calling
the backgroundSheet. Eg, instead of 16*x and 16*y, you can have the bg image at
8*x and 8*y, then set enlargement to 2x (in theory)
To get an idea of scale, use a grid of (16*8)x(9*8)y for the above example

For maps; 9 pixels is one screen height
In GIMP, setting up a 16*9 grid is handy for this

An index of 0 is furthest away (bg0.png looks like it's furthest away from the player)

EDIT: SEE block.conf file for ID's etc
